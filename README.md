# Protein-Complex-Alpha-Shape
Protein structure determines protein function is a fundamental problem in molecular biology. We can use Computational Geometry to study the geometry, shape, physicochemical texture of binding surfaces to understand how they work and how functional roles of proteins can be predicted.
